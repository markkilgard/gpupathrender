\subsection{NVIDIA Resources}

NVIDIA provides developer resources for you to get started programming
with {\tt NV\_path\_rendering}.

}

NVIDIA's {\tt NV\_path\_rendering} Path Rendering Software Development
Kit (NVprSDK) contains eleven complete examples of varying complexity.
The most complex example is capable of rendering an interesting subset
of SVG.

\subsection{Other Resources}

The OpenGL Extension Wrangler (GLEW) \cite{GLEW} includes support
for the {\tt NV\_path\_rendering} extension so GLEW provides a hassle-free
way to gain
access to the extension's OpenGL entry points.

\subsection{Driver Availability}

The first NVIDIA driver to support {\tt NV\_path\_rendering} is Release
275.33 (June 2011).  Drivers from Release 301.42 (May 2012) have
substantially better rendering performance, particularly for GeForce
400 and later GPUs (so-called Fermi or Kepler based GPUs).
We are continuing to improve the performance of {\tt NV\_path\_rendering}
so obtain the most recent available driver version.
