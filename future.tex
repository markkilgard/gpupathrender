We believe our performance can be further improved.  We are investigating
hardware improvements to mitigate some of the memory bandwidth expense
involved in our underlying stencil-based algorithms.  In particular,
we are seeking to reduce the GPU memory footprint.

Web browser architecture should change to incorporate GPU-accelerated
path rendering.  Today web browsers
respecify paths every time a web page with path content is re-rendered
assuming respecifying paths is cheap relative to the expense of rendering them.
When path rendering is fully GPU-accelerated, a retained model of
rendering is more appropriate and  efficient.  We believe web browsers
should behave more like video games in this respect to exploit the GPU.

Mobile devices are power constrained so off-loading path rendering to
a graphics processor designed for efficient pixel processing
makes good sense.  Mobile devices in particular prize a low-latency
experience for the user so the sooner the device can complete its
resolution-independent 2D rendering, the better the user experience and
the sooner the device can power down to a low power state.
