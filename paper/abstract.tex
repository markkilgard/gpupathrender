For thirty years, resolution-independent 2D standards (e.g. PostScript,
SVG) have depended on CPU-based algorithms for the filling and
stroking of paths.  Advances in graphics hardware have largely
ignored accelerating resolution-independent 2D graphics
rendered from paths.

We introduce a two-step ``Stencil, then Cover'' (StC) programming
interface.  Our GPU-based approach builds upon existing techniques for curve
rendering using the stencil buffer, but we {\em explicitly} decouple
in our programming interface the {\em stencil step} to determine
a path's filled or stroked coverage from the subsequent {\em cover
step} to rasterize conservative geometry intended to test and reset the
coverage determinations of the first step while shading color samples
within the path.  Our goals are completeness, correctness, quality, and
performance---yet we go further to unify path rendering with OpenGL's
established 3D and shading pipeline.  We have built and productized our
approach to accelerate path rendering as an OpenGL extension.
